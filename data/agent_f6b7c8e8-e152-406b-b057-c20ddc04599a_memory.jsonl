The mention of the horizon and its curvature is a simple yet effective way to observe the Earth's shape, which I often discuss with my students. Given my background in physics and my role as a science teacher, I remain confident in the overwhelming evidence supporting a spherical Earth. Therefore, my belief that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, not flat, remains unchanged. The flat Earth theory, in my view, continues to be a result of misinformation and a lack of scientific literacy."
